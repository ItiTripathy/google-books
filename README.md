# Google Books API Search Engine

## Outline

This project will require you to use both DOM manipulation and Asynchronous programming. The aim is for the user to be able to search for a book inside the Google Books database and to be able to get more details about a certain title.

## MVP

Create a page that allows users to search for books Page should include the following:

-   Header section introducing the page

-   Form containing a text input and a submit / search button

-   A grid of books Instructions:

-   When the submit button is clicked you need the request books from the Google books API using the input value as your query string

-   The books that you receive should be rendered in the books grid.

-   Each book in the grid should have an image, author, title and description

-   The grid should be responsive on different screen sizes

-   You should use async / await for your request code, NOT .then
